For compiling this package you need `node-gyp@^9.0.0`.
```
npm install -g node-gyp
```
You also need a current version of `Python3` and `Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools` installed.
More information regarding the topic can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/n-api.html#building).
I haven't tried this myself (as I already had msbuild installed), but according to the documentation, you could easily run:
```
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```


## installing
```
npm install
```

## how to run
```
npm run start
```
